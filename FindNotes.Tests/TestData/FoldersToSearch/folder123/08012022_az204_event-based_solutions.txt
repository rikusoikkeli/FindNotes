CONTROL ACCESS TO EVENTS

Azure built-in roles for authorising access to Event Hubs data (using AAD and OAuth)
- Azure Event Hubs Data Owner
- Azure Event Hubs Data Sender
- Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver


Authorise access to publishers
- A client that holds a token can only send to one publisher. If multiple clients share the same token, then each of them shares the publisher.
- All tokens are assigned with shared access signature keys (typically with same key)
	- Clients aren't aware of the key.
