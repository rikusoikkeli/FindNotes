Azure Event Hub

Key Service Characteristics
- Big data event streaming service
- Scalable up to terabytes of data and millions of events per second
- Reliable with zero data loss (agnostic to failures)
- Supports multiple protocols and SDKs

When to use it?
- Anomaly detection (fraud/outliers)
- Application logging
- Analytics pipelines, such as clickstreams
- Live dashboarding
- Archiving data
- Transaction processing
- User telemetry processing
- Device telemetry streaming

Key Concepts
- Event producers send events via AMQP, HTTP or Apache Kafka
- Separated (Event Hub) in 1* to 32 partitions
- Load balanced distribution (of events between partitions)
- Each partition is ordered
	- e.g. all events in partition 4 are ordered from oldest to newest
- Partition Key allows for ordered processing
	- By definition, order is not maintained across partitions
	- Add partition key to events so they'll land into the same partition
- Event hub represents a unique stream of data
- Event hub namespace is a collection of event hubs
	- Scoping container
	- Shared properties
	- Accessible via FQDN

When you create Event Hubs resource in Azure, you create an Event Hub namespace

To connect to an Event Hub through an SDK, you need a connection string
- Event Hubs Instance -> Shared access policies -> Add -> Connection string-primary key

Key Concepts 2
- Consumer Group is unique view on event hub data
- Consumers are processes that read event data (AMQP 1.0)
- Offset is the position of an event
- Checkpointing is a progress of saving offset on client side
	- If you have millions of events and client dies, you don't want to start from beginning
	- Each consumer group manages its own checkpointing
	- SDKs can save offsets to Azure blob storage

What else do you get?
	- Event Capture
		- Enables automatic delivery of the streaming data to blob storage or data lake
	- Auto scaling with auto-inflate
	- Geo-disaster recovery via geo-replication with region pairing

- Azure Event Hubs represents the "front door" for an event pipeline
	- aka event ingestor
		- sits between publishers and consumers for decoupling purposes
- PaaS (Platform as a Service)

Key concepts
- A consumer group 
	- it is recommended that there is only one active consumer for a given partition and 	consumer group pairing
